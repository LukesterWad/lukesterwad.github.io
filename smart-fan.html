						my fan but smarter
					</h3>
					<p>
						My room never stays the same level of heat. It can
						hardly remain habitable for more than a minute, and I
						don't want to deal with the physical challenge of
						constantly turning something on and off that my lovely
						Argos-sourced, £10 fan imposes on me. It was my 7th or
						8th week of teetering temperature, I was sitting at my
						desk waiting for summer to be over. It was in that
						moment of realization, "what the hell am I doing
						flipping this dastardly switch for the 100th time?" that
						led me to seek out a solution. The solution was obvious,
						buy a fan that regulates itself. I guess I forgot how
						little money I had, because for a second, I actually
						thought I could afford the £140+ price tag (yes, that's really how much they cost) . I
						begrudgingly snapped back to reality and figured it
						wouldn't be worth it at that price point. Then I
						thought, "why not just make one myself?", I've made
						everything from PC gesture-control to a camera-spinning
						panorama constructor.
					</p>
					<p>
						I ordered a cheap RasPi Zero W off of PiHut and began
						tinkering around with the GPIO Python integration.
						Unfortunately, my GCSE CS exam was coming up soon and I
						tend to favor personal projects over studying, so the
						project fell by the wayside. At least it did for a
						couple months until I was free from the trecherous hours
						I had to spend with my head in a textbook, and I was
						presented with a convenient opportunity to assert my
						dominance over my friends.
					</p>
					<p>
						Stemming from the completion of GCSE Computer Science,
						one of my friends suggested a competition to see who can
						best apply their acquired knowledge. I glady accepted...
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyway, I stayed up a couple of nights in a row
						developing the code and got a prototype working but with
						only LEDs rather than a full appliance. It functioned
						surprisingly well, with complete client and server side
						applications. It was at a point where I felt it could be
						scaled up with a couple of hardware improvements. I
						figured an explanation of the inner workings would make
						for an interesting read.
					</p>
					<h4 style="text-align: center">hardware</h4>
					<p>
						In all transparency, I'm a software guy who can do
						hardware, not the other way around. That being said, I'm
						going to cover hardware first because it's fairly simple
						(relative to the software at least) and I just want to
						get it out of the way. I threw together this dumbed down
						schematic to help with my explination.
					</p>
					<!--! important diagram needed -->
					<p>
						There were 5 major components:
						<li class="article-list" style="margin-top: -20px">
							RasPi Zero W
						</li>
						<li class="article-list">
							High Torque Servo
						</li>
						<li class="article-list">
							Microcontroller (ATMEGA 328p)
						</li>
						<li class="article-list">
							Temperature Sensor (Dallas DS18B20)
						</li>
						<li class="article-list">
							A Cheap Rechargable Battery Pack
						</li>
					</p>
					<p>
						The ATMEGA 328p acts as a center of communication for
						the system. It processes data sent by the Pi and issues
						instructions for the servo accordingly. I'll cover the
						code that's written onto the microcontroller in the
						software portion. The Pi pairs with the user interface
						through POST requests to a NodeJS server run on the Pi
						itself. Upon receiving a post request, it sends the
						relevant data to the microcontroller for further
						processing. If the encrypted information is verified to
						be from a valid copy of the UI, it instructs the servo
						to turn to either 0° or 90°, flicking the plug socket
						switch.
					</p>
					<p>
						It should be noted that data is only transmitted one
						way, from the app to the Pi server, not vice versa.
						However, 2 way communication is very simple to
						implement, I had to hack most of the project together in
						a weekend, so I was on a bit of a time crunch. I even
						went as far as to add a voltage divider between the TX
						pin of the microcontroller and chosen input pin of the
						Pi in the case I wanted 2 way communication. You need to
						add this because the GPIO communicates on 3.3v while the
						ATMEGA 328p communicates on 5v, meaning that the
						microcontroller can cause issues by sending it data
						(without a voltage divider).
					</p>
					<h4 style="text-align: center">software</h4>
					<p>
						There are 3 major pieces of software in the system: the
						mobile app and microcontroller instructions. I wrote the
						mobile app in C# with the Xamarin framework, which is a
						very powerful cross platform app building tool (However,
						I was only able to build it using native Android API
						calls, because I only have an Android device to test
						on). The server on the Pi was written in JavaScript
						paired the NodeJS runtime environment, which lets JS run
						outside of a web browser. And I wrote the
						microcontroller instructions in C with the Arduino
						compiler. I was thinking about using ATMEL studio/
						compiler instead, but the program's simplicity meant it
						didn't need access to any lower level instructions.
					</p>
					<p>
						The heart of the microcontroller instructions is the
						override of its serialEvent function:
					</p>
					<pre style="font-size: 18px" id="pre-fan-code">
void serialEvent() {
	byte inputData[6];
	Serial.readBytes(inputData, 6);

	if(getKey(inputData, 6) == "some arbitrary key for lock"){
	servo.write(90);
	}
	if(getKey(inputData, 6) == "some arbitrary key for unlock"){ 
	servo.write(0);  
	}
}
        </pre
					>
					<pre id="fan-code-error">
Screen too small
to display code.
Try rotating.
					</pre
					>
					<p>
						As I mentioned, the code written onto the ATMEGA 328p is
						very simple. On a serial event, we write the next 6
						bytes of data into a byte array "inputData". We then
						compare the return value of the getKey function passed
						the aforementioned byte array against some arbitrary key
						values. The getKey function decrypts the data and parses
						it to a string. If these keys match one of our two
						pre-set keys, the microcontroller tells the servo to
						turn to either 0° or 90°, closing or opening the outlet
						switch respectively.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now for the exciting part, the app itself. I actually
						managed to flesh out a proper GUI which I wasn't hopeful
						of. Upon installing the app's .sdk there is a simple
						setup process. The randomly generated key values on the
						microcontroller need to be entered initially. The data
						is then encrypted and stored for continued use, although
						it can be changed down the line.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next part of the setup process is the simplest but
						unfortunately takes a while to complete. The network is
						scanned for a Pi over WiFi, and then it stores the IP
						and MAC addresses used for verification and sending the
						POST requests.

						sleep...
